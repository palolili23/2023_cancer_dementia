## Introduction

.pull-left[

Observational studies have found a protective effect of cancer diagnosis in the risk of Alzheimer´s disease or related dementias (ADRD).

These studies lead to discussions of repurposing or augmenting current cancer chemotherapeutics for ADRD

## How can we conclude on causal pathways with observational data?

---

## Aims

- To progressively build a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) which help us connect the causal question to the observable data and the assumptions we rely on to identify the effect.  

--

- To exemplify different scenarios with real data collected from the Rotterdam Study. 

--

- To describe the challenges and how they translate into the analytic decisions.

---

### Causal question

.pull-left[

What is the effect of a drug targeted to Pin1 $(D)$ in the risk of ADRD at time *t* $(Y_{t})$  compared to standard treatments?

We can imagine an RCT where middle-aged participants with signs of cognitive decline are recruited.

- The drug is not available yet, but we have better chances of having Pin1 expression as a biomarker in a closer future.

- This biomarker could be measured in stored blood samples in a cohort study

- We can set a threshold for _Pin1 over-expression_ = $P$

- Since this is within an observational setting we will have to address confounding $(L)$

In this setting death is treated as a censoring event and it can be interpreted as those who died would have the same risk of developing dementia if prevented from dying than those who remained alive and free of dementia at a given time point, conditional on shared causes of dementia and death

## Application to the Rotterdam Study

We conduct an analysis of the cancer-ADRD association that is structured to the best of the available data’s abilities to inform the possible effect of Pin1 on all cause-dementia

--

- Participants between 60 and 70 years old at study entry
- Without history of cancer diagnosis and dementia
- Data on cancer diagnosis and dementia diagnosis is measured through follow-up and linkage with national registries.
- Date and cause of death was collected on a weekly basis via municipal population registries
- Data on covariates is measured repeatedly over visits and through linkage to EHR




---

### Methods

We considered 3 scenarios to define Pin1 over-expression:

--

- _"Cancer ever vs. never"_ as if Pin1 measurement and cancer diagnosis happened at the same time if looked retrospectively. 

--

- Cancer as a _"time-varying"_ exposure independent of death. 

--

- _"Time to cancer diagnosis"_ as the proxy for Pin1 over-expression.

--

We used inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) to address confounding. 

---

### Methods

- To compare the risk of dementia at 20 years of follow-up, in a setting were death could have been prevented, we compared the complement of a weighted Kaplan-Meier survival estimator in participants with incident cancer vs. no incident of cancer with time indexed in years.

--

- The weights in this case are time-varying by follow-up year, defined as a product of the time-fixed IPT weights above and a year-specific inverse probability of censoring by death weights (IPC).  

--

- For an individual still alive in year _t_, the time _t_ IPC weight is the product of the inverse probability of surviving in each year prior to _t_, conditional on measured common causes of death and dementia. For an individual who has died by time t, the year t IPC weight is zero.

--

- We additionally calculated the direct effect considering death as an unconditional independent censoring event (as if there were no arrows from {C} to $D_{t}$ and $Y_{t+1}$) for an illustrative purpose.

---

### Methods

Since the independent censoring assumption is untestable, we can consider extreme scenarios of independence and fit Peterson upper and lower bounds.

--

1) Total independence, that refers to an scenario were those who died would never develop dementia (lower bound).
  + Aalen-Johansen estimator treating death as a competing event.

--

2) Complete dependency, that refers to an scenario where those who died would have dementia prior to death (upper bound). 
  + The Kaplan Meier estimator for the combined outcome of dementia or death.

```

---

### Thoughts so far...

- There big gap between what we measure and analyze as exposures, and what we truly want to study. 

--

- The process of connecting our real question to the data help us identify the structure that will later represent the analytic decisions and assumptions.

--

- When death is a competing event, prior to choosing the estimator we need to define what is the estimand of interest and be explicit about the assumptions and interpretations.

--

- Descriptive information, such as % of people who died in each arm should be always presented.

---

### Questions

- How can I make my points clear for a wide audience?

- What to add, what to remove?
