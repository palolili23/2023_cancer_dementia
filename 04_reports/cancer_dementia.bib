Furthermore, the genetically modulated reduction of capacity for neural repair and neurotransmitter activity, as well as reduced antioxidant capacity associated with treatmentinduced reduction in oestrogen and testosterone levels, might interact with these mechanisms and/ or have independent effects on cognitive function.},

  abstract = {Background In studies of all-cause mortality, the fundamental epidemiological concepts of rate and risk are connected through a well-defined one-to-one relation. An important consequence of this relation is that regression models such as the proportional hazards model that are defined through the hazard (the rate) immediately dictate how the covariates relate to the survival function (the risk). Methods This introductory paper reviews the concepts of rate and risk and their one-to-one relation in all-cause mortality studies and introduces the analogous concepts of rate and risk in the context of competing risks, the cause-specific hazard and the cause-specific cumulative incidence function. Results The key feature of competing risks is that the one-to-one correspondence between cause-specific hazard and cumulative incidence, between rate and risk, is lost. This fact has two important implications. First, the na\textasciidieresis\i ve Kaplan\textendash Meier that takes the competing events as censored observations, is biased. Secondly, the way in which covariates are associated with the cause-specific hazards may not coincide with the way these covariates are associated with the cumulative incidence. An example with relapse and non-relapse mortality as competing risks in a stem cell transplantation study is used for illustration. Conclusion The two implications of the loss of one-to-one correspondence between cause-specific hazard and cumulative incidence should be kept in mind when deciding on how to make inference in a competing risks situation.},

  abstract = {Increased survival, differentiation, and apoptotic death are common mechanisms relevant for both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Although these disorders are characterized by different manifestations, it appears that a common mechanism may be present which directs the fate of a cell to either degeneration or proliferation. There are two classes of proteins that have been extensively investigated in these diseases but their possible interaction during signal transduction has not been studied. Prolyl isomerase Pin1 is an enzyme which translates Ser/Thr-Pro phosphorylation into conformational changes able to modify the activities of its substrates. Its role in cancer development has been linked to its capacity to induce conformational changes to the tumor suppressor gene p53. Neurotrophins belong to a family of proteins that induce opposite effects on neuronal cells such as increased survival, development, and function. According to their function, alteration of these proteins during neurodegenerative processes has been investigated and reported in a number of experimental paradigms involving animal models and humans. However, in recent years, it has been shown that Pin1 downregulation is present in neurodegenerative disorders, while increased expression of neurotrophins and their receptors is found in certain types of cancer and correlate with poor prognosis. Notably, at the level of signal transduction, Pin1 and neurotrophin activity regulate the outcome of similar pathways such as proline-directed kinase and, most importantly, p53 signaling. Thus the possible existence of a loop between Pin1 and neurotrophins was investigated to understand the pathogenesis of these diseases.},

In a prospective longitudinal study we have previously shown an inverse association between AD and cancer, such that the rate of developing cancer in general with time was significantly slower in participants with AD, while participants with a history of cancer had a slower rate of developing AD. In cancer, cell regulation mechanisms are disrupted with augmentation of cell survival and/or proliferation, whereas conversely, AD is associated with increased neuronal death, either caused by, or concomitant with, beta amyloid (A{$\beta$}) and tau deposition. The possibility that perturbations of mechanisms involved in cell survival/death regulation could be involved in both disorders is discussed. Genetic polymorphisms, DNA methylation or other mechanisms that induce changes in activity of molecules with key roles in determining the decision to ``repair and live''- or ``die'' could be involved in the pathogenesis of the two disorders. As examples, the role of p53, Pin1 and the Wnt signaling pathway are discussed as potential candidates that, speculatively, may explain inverse associations between AD and cancer.},

Methods The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-3 (HOPE-3) study was a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled clinical trial using a 2 \texttimes{} 2 factorial design. Participants without known cardiovascular disease or need for treatment were randomized to candesartan (16 mg) plus hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) or placebo and to rosuvastatin (10 mg) or placebo. Participants who were {$\geq$}70 years of age completed the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the modified Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and the Trail Making Test Part B at baseline and study end. Results Cognitive assessments were completed by 2,361 participants from 228 centers in 21 countries. Compared with placebo, candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide reduced systolic blood pressure by 6.0 mm Hg, and rosuvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 24.8 mg/dL. Participants were followed up for 5.7 years (median), and 1,626 completed both baseline and study-end assessments. Mean participant age was 74 years (SD {$\pm$}3.5 years); 59\% were women; 45\% had hypertension; and 24\% had {$\geq$}12 years of education. The mean difference in change in DSST scores was -0.91 (95\% confidence interval [CI] -2.25 to 0.42) for candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide compared with placebo, -0.54 (95\% CI -1.88 to 0.80) for rosuvastatin compared with placebo, and -1.43 (95\% CI -3.37 to 0.50) for combination therapy vs double placebo. No significant differences were found for other measures. Conclusions Long-term blood pressure lowering with candesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide, rosuvastatin, or their combination did not significantly affect cognitive decline in older people.},

  abstract = {Objective: Observational data can be used to attempt to emulate a target trial of statin use and estimate analogues of intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects on dementia risk. Methods: Using data from a prospective cohort study in the Netherlands, we conceptualized a sequence of ``trials'' in which eligible individuals ages 55-80 years were classified as statin D initiators or non-initiators for every consecutive month between 1993 and 2007 and were followed until diagnosis of dementia, death, loss to follow-up, or the end of follow-up. We E estimated two types of effects of statin use on dementia and a combined endpoint of dementia or death: the effect of initiation versus no initiation and the effect of sustained use versus no use. T We estimated risk by statin treatment strategy over time via pooled logistic regression. We used P inverse-probability weighting to account for treatment-confounder feedback in estimation of perprotocol effects. E Results: Of 233,526 eligible person-trials (6,373 individuals), there were 622 initiators and 232,904 non-initiators. Comparing statin initiation with no initiation, the 10-year risk differences C (95\% CI) were -0.1\% (-2.3\%, 1.8\%) for dementia and 0.3\% (-2.7\%, 3.3\%) for dementia or death. Comparing sustained statin use versus no use, the 10-year risk differences were -2.2\% (-5.2\%, AC 1.6\%) for dementia and -5.1\% (-10.5\%, -1.1\%) for dementia or death. Conclusions: Individuals with sustained statin use, but not statin initiation alone, had reduced 10-year risks of dementia and dementia or death. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of initiators and events, and potential for residual confounding.},

Design Community based prospective cohort study; nested age and sex matched case-control study. Setting Framingham Heart Study, USA. Participants 1278 participants with and without a history of cancer who were aged 65 or more and free of dementia at baseline (1986-90). Main outcome measures Hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for the risks of Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Results Over a mean follow-up of 10 years, 221 cases of probable Alzheimer's disease were diagnosed. Cancer survivors had a lower risk of probable Alzheimer's disease (hazard ratio 0.67, 95\% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.97), adjusted for age, sex, and smoking. The risk was lower among survivors of smoking related cancers (0.26, 0.08 to 0.82) than among survivors of non-smoking related cancers (0.82, 0.57 to 1.19). In contrast with their decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease, survivors of smoking related cancer had a substantially increased risk of stroke (2.18, 1.29 to 3.68). In the nested case-control analysis, participants with probable Alzheimer's disease had a lower risk of subsequent cancer (0.39, 0.26 to 0.58) than reference participants, as did participants with any Alzheimer's disease (0.38) and any dementia (0.44).

  abstract = {Background: Several small scale clinical trials indicated a possible relationship between chemotherapy administration and the increased risk of cognitive impairments in patients with breast cancer, but little information was available from large population-based cohort studies. Methods: We studied 62,565 women who were diagnosed with stages I-IV breast cancer at age Ն65 years from 1991 through 2002 from 16 regions in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program who were free of cognitive impairments at diagnosis with up to 16 years of follow-up, and also studied 9752 matched cohort based on the propensity of receiving chemotherapy. The cumulative incidence of cognitive impairments was calculated and the time to event (cognitive impairments) analysis was conducted using Cox hazard regression model. Results: Overall, patients who received chemotherapy were 8\% more likely to have drug-induced dementia compared with those without chemotherapy, but that was not statistically significant after adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics (hazard ratio ϭ 1.08, 95\% confidence interval ϭ 0.85\textendash 1.37). The risk of developing Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, or other dementias was significantly lower in patients receiving chemotherapy except for cognitive disorder which was not significantly different between the 2 chemotherapy groups. The results were somewhat similar in the entire cohort and the matched cohort based on the probability of receiving chemotherapy. Conclusion: There was no significant association between chemotherapy and the risk of developing drug-induced dementia and unspecified cognitive disorders. The risk of developing Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, or other dementias was significantly lower in patients receiving chemotherapy. This study with long-term follow-up did not support the findings that chemotherapy was associated with an increased risk of late stage cognitive impairments.},

  abstract = {Many scientific problems require that treatment comparisons be adjusted for posttreatment variables, but the estimands underlying standard methods are not causal effects. To address this deficiency, we propose a general framework for comparing treatments adjusting for posttreatment variables that yields principal effects based on principal stratification. Principal stratification with respect to a posttreatment variable is a cross-classification of subjects defined by the joint potential values of that posttreatment variable under each of the treatments being compared. Principal effects are causal effects within a principal stratum. The key property of principal strata is that they are not affected by treatment assignment and therefore can be used just as any pretreatment covariate, such as age category. As a result, the central property of our principal effects is that they are always causal effects and do not suffer from the complications of standard posttreatment-adjusted estimands. We discuss briefly that such principal causal effects are the link between three recent applications with adjustment for posttreatment variables: (i) treatment noncompliance, (ii) missing outcomes (dropout) following treatment noncompliance, and (iii) censoring by death. We then attack the problem of surrogate or biomarker endpoints, where we show, using principal causal effects, that all current definitions of surrogacy, even when perfectly true, do not generally have the desired interpretation as causal effects of treatment on outcome. We go on to formulate estimands based on principal stratification and principal causal effects and show their superiority.},

We applied unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazards ratios (HRs). We also evaluated cancer in relation to automobile injuries as a negative control to explore potential study biases. In the case\textendash control analysis, cancer cases were less likely to have a prior diagnosis of AD than controls (OR = 0.86; 95\% CI = 0.81\textendash 0.92). Cancer cases were also less likely than controls to have prior injuries from automobile accidents to the same degree (OR = 0.83; 95\% CI = 0.78\textendash 0.88). In the prospective cohort, there was a lower risk observed in cancer survivors, HR = 0.87 (95\% CI = 0.84\textendash 0.90). In contrast, there was no association between cancer diagnosis and subsequent automobile accident injuries (HR = 1.03; 95\% CI = 0.98\textendash 1.07). That cancer risks were similarly reduced after both AD and automobile injuries suggest biases against detecting cancer in persons with unrelated medical conditions. The modestly lower AD risk in cancer survivors may reflect underdiagnosis of AD in those with a serious illness. This study does not support a relationship between cancer and AD.},

A wealth of observational data suggest (1) reduced risk of certain cancers in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases; and (2) increased risk of other cancers in Parkinson disease. These relationships persist despite correcting for reporting artifacts and survival bias. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed and warrant further investigation. Aging is a risk factor for both. Common environmental exposures, such as smoking, may play roles. Common mechanisms such as chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, and common risk factors such as diabetes and obesity, have been implicated. Shared genetic pathways are a major focus, particularly those favoring apoptosis and cell proliferation at opposite ends of the spectrum. To complicate the picture further, certain cancer chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy agents have neurotoxic effects, whereas animal studies show other cancer drugs reducing neurodegeneration, raising the possibility of repurposing those agents for use in Alzheimer disease. These multiple potential lines of evidence must be disentangled to investigate underlying mechanisms, the end-game being to develop and to test potential prevention and treatment strategies.},

Methotrexate results in persistent activation of microglia and subsequent astrocyte activation that is dependent on inflammatory microglia. Microglial depletion normalizes oligodendroglial lineage dynamics, myelin microstructure, and cognitive behavior after methotrexate chemotherapy. These findings indicate that methotrexate chemotherapy exposure is associated with persistent tri-glial dysregulation and identify inflammatory microglia as a therapeutic target to abrogate chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment.},

OPCs from chemotherapy-naive mice similarly exhibit increased differentiation when transplanted into the microenvironment of previously methotrexate-exposed brains, indicating an underlying microenvironmental perturbation. Methotrexate results in persistent activation of microglia and subsequent astrocyte activation that is dependent on inflammatory microglia. Microglial depletion normalizes oligodendroglial lineage dynamics, myelin microstructure, and cognitive behavior after methotrexate chemotherapy. These findings indicate that methotrexate chemotherapy exposure is associated with persistent tri-glial dysregulation and identify inflammatory microglia as a therapeutic target to abrogate chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment.},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the association of early-adulthood and mid-adulthood hypertension with dementia in men and women. Methods: We evaluated 5,646 members of a diverse integrated health care delivery system who had clinical examinations and health survey data from 1964 to 1973 (mean age 32.7 years; early adulthood) and 1978\textendash 1985 (mean age 44.3 years; mid-adulthood) and were members as of January 1, 1996 (mean age 59.8 years). Hypertension categories based on measurements of blood pressure (BP) and change in hypertension categories between the 2 examinations (e.g., onset hypertension) were used to predict dementia incidence from January 1, 1996, to September 30, 2015. Cox proportional hazard models were adjusted for demographics, vascular comorbidities, and hypertension treatment; inverse probability weighting accounted for differential attrition between first BP measurement and start of follow-up. Results: A total of 532 individuals (9.4\%) were diagnosed with dementia. Early adulthood hypertension was not associated with dementia, though effect estimates were elevated among women. Mid-adulthood hypertension was associated with 65\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.25\textendash 2.18) increased dementia risk among women but not men. Onset of hypertension in mid-adulthood predicted 73\% higher dementia risk in women (95\% CI 1.24\textendash 2.40) compared to stable normotensive. There was no evidence that hypertension or changes in hypertension increased dementia risk among men. Conclusions: Though midlife hypertension was more common in men, it was only associated with dementia risk in women. Sex differences in the timing of dementia risk factors have important implications for brain health and hypertension management. Neurology\textregistered{} 2017;89:1886\textendash 1893},

  abstract = {Objective:\hspace{0.6em} Several studies have suggested that cancer is associated with a reduced risk of the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study seeks to improve our understanding of the association between cancer and the development of AD by showing how mortality selection alters this relationship. Method:\hspace{0.6em} A retrospective cohort study was carried out examining 92,425 individuals (47,873 women and 44,552 men) from the Utah Population Database with and without a history of any primary cancer identified by the Utah Cancer Registry. All individuals were aged 65\textendash 79 years and free of dementia in 1992 and followed for upwards of 18 years (1992\textendash 2009) for AD ascertainment, which was identified using diagnostic information from Medicare claims data. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We replicate previous results suggesting that cancer is associated with reduced risk of subsequent AD under specific statistical model specifications. However, these results should not be interpreted as evidence of an etiological association. We conclude that higher rates of overall mortality among individuals with cancer relative to those without cancer induce the widely reported putative protective association with cancer. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Careful consideration of model specification and the profound effects of mortality selection in the older adult population is essential when investigating the relationship between aging-related diseases such as cancer and AD. We show that cancer does not provide protection from AD as previously described in the literature. Social scientists seeking to understand social disparities in disease outcomes among older adults may therefore want to strongly consider the role of mortality selection which, if uncorrected, may generate biased associations.},

This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects (``selection bias'') and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome (``confounding''). This classification also leads to a unified approach to adjust for selection bias.},

Over the past 15 years, stratification-based techniques as well as methods such as inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation have been more prominently discussed and offered as a means to correct for selection bias. However, unlike correcting for confounding bias using inverse weighting, uptake of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation as well as competing methods has been limited in the applied epidemiologic literature. To motivate greater use of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and competing methods, we use causal diagrams to describe the sources of selection bias in cohort studies employing a time-toevent framework when the quantity of interest is an absolute measure (e.g., absolute risk, survival function) or relative effect measure (e.g., risk difference, risk ratio). We highlight that whether a given estimate obtained from standard methods is potentially subject to selection bias depends on the causal diagram and the measure. We first broadly describe inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and then give a simple example to demonstrate in detail how inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation mitigates selection bias and describe challenges to estimation. We then modify complex, real-world data from the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV clinical cohort study and estimate the absolute and relative change in the occurrence of death with and without inverse probability-of-censoring weighted correction using the modified University of North Carolina data. We provide SAS code to aid with implementation of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted techniques.},

This difficulty stems from the fact that frequently employed analytic techniques require that common causes of survival and the outcome are accurately measured. Unfortunately, such common causes are often unmeasured or poorly measured in racial health disparities studies. In the absence of accurate measures of the aforementioned common causes, redefining the target population or changing the study design represents a useful approach for reducing the extent of survival-related selection bias. To help researchers recognize and minimize survival-related selection bias in racial health disparities studies, we illustrate the aforementioned selection bias and how redefining the target population or changing the study design can be useful.},

  abstract = {Background: Advances in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in oncology have significantly increased the chance of survival of cancer patients, even those with metastatic disease. However, cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is frequently reported in patients treated for non-central nervous system cancers, particularly during and after chemotherapy. Design: This review provides an update of the state of the art based on PubMed searches between 2012 and March 2019 on `cognition', `cancer', `antineoplastic agents' or `chemotherapy'. It includes the most recent clinical, imaging and pre-clinical data and reports management strategies of CRCI. Results: Evidence obtained primarily from studies on breast cancer patients highlight memory, processing speed, attention and executive functions as the most cognitive domains impaired post-chemotherapy. Recent investigations established that other cancer treatments, such as hormone therapies and targeted therapies, can also induce cognitive deficits. Knowledge regarding predisposing factors, biological markers or brain functions associated with CRCI has improved. Factors such as age and genetic polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E, catechol-O-methyltransferase and BDNF may predispose individuals to a higher risk of cognitive impairment. Poor performance on neuropsychological tests were associated with volume reduction in grey matter, less connectivity and activation after chemotherapy. In animals, hippocampus-based memory and executive functions, mediated by the frontal lobes, were shown to be particularly susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy. It involves altered neurogenesis, mitochondrial dysfunction or brain cytokine response. An important next step is to identify strategies for managing cognitive difficulties, with primary studies to assess cognitive training and physical exercise regimens. Conclusions: CRCI is not limited to chemotherapy. A multidisciplinary approach has improved our knowledge of the complex mechanisms involved. Nowadays, studies evaluating cognitive rehabilitation programmes are encouraged to help patients cope with cognitive difficulties and improve quality of life during and after cancer.},

  abstract = {Several epidemiological studies show an inverse association between cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is debated whether this association is the consequence of biological mechanisms shared by both these conditions or may be related to the pharmacological treatments carried out on the patients. The latter hypothesis, however, is not sustained by the available evidence. Hence, the focus of this review is to analyze common biological mechanisms for both cancer and AD and to build up a biological theory useful to explain the inverse correlation between AD and cancer. The review proposes a hypothesis, according to which several molecular players, prominently PIN1 and p53, have been investigated and considered involved in complex molecular interactions putatively associated with the inverse correlation. On the other hand, p53 involvement in both diseases seems to be a consequence of the aberrant activation of other proteins. Instead, PIN1 may be identified as a novel key regulator at the crossroad between cancer and AD. PIN1 is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase that catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization, thus regulating the conformation of different protein substrates after phosphorylation and modulating protein function. In particular, trans-conformations of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and tau are functional and ``healthy'', while cis-conformations, triggered after phosphorylation, are pathogenic. As an example, PIN1 accelerates APP cis-to-trans isomerization thus favoring the non-amyloidogenic pathway, while, in the absence of PIN1, APP is processed through the amyloidogenic pathway, thus predisposing to neurodegeneration. Furthermore, a link between PIN1 and tau regulation has been found, since when PIN1 function is inhibited, tau is hyperphosphorylated. Data from brain specimens of subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment and AD have revealed a very low PIN1 expression. Moreover, polymorphisms in PIN1 promoter correlated with an increased PIN1 expression are associated with a delay of sporadic AD age of onset, while a polymorphism related to a reduced PIN1 expression is associated with a decreased risk of multiple cancers. In the case of dementias, in particular of Alzheimer's disease, new biological markers and targets based on the discussed players can be developed based on a theoretical approach relying on different grounds compared to the past. An unbiased expansion of the rationale and of the targets may help to achieve in the field of neurodegenerative dementias similar advances to those attained in the case of cancer treatment.},

  abstract = {Background: Published in 2019, a new addendum to the ICH E9 guideline presents the estimand framework as a systematic approach to ensure alignment among clinical trial objectives, trial execution/conduct, statistical analyses, and interpretation of results. The use of the estimand framework for describing clinical trial objectives has yet to be extensively considered in the context of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We discuss the application of the estimand framework to PRO objectives when designing clinical trials in the future, with a focus on PRO outcomes in oncology trial settings as our example. Main: We describe the components of an estimand and take a na\"ive PRO trial objective to illustrate how to apply attributes described in the estimand framework to inform construction of a detailed clinical trial objective and its related estimand. We discuss identifying potential post-randomization events that alter the interpretation of the endpoint or render its observation impossible (also defined as intercurrent events) in the context of PRO endpoints, and the implications of how to handle intercurrent events in the construction of the PRO objective. Using a simple objective statement, ``What is the effect of treatment X on patient's quality of life?'', we build up an example estimand statement and also use a previously published phase III oncology clinical trial to illustrate how an estimand for a PRO objective could have been written to align to the estimate framework. Conclusion: The use of the estimand framework, as described in the new ICH E9 (R1) addendum guideline will become a key common framework for developing clinical trial objectives for evaluating effects of treatment. In the context of considering PROs, the framework provides an opportunity to more precisely specify and build the rationale for patient-focused objectives. This will help to ensure that clinical trials used for registration are designed and analysed appropriately, enabling all stakeholders to accurately interpret conclusions about the treatment effects for patient-focused outcomes.},

Six studies met the inclusion criteria in the overall meta-analysis. We pooled effect sizes using fixed-effects and random-effects models. Furthermore, we also tested for heterogeneity and publication bias. The results suggested that individuals diagnosed with AD had a decreased risk for incident cancer by 42\% (95\% CI, 0.40\textendash 0.86; p {$<$} 0.05), and patients with a history of cancer had a 37\% decreased risk of AD (RR = 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.56\textendash 0.72; p = 0.495). The Egger's test for publication bias (p = 0.280) showed no significant evidence for bias in the data from studies on AD and cancer risk. In summary, our meta-analysis demonstrated an inverse association between cancer and AD.},

  abstract = {Acquiring real-world evidence is crucial to support health policy, but observational studies are prone to serious biases. An approach was recently proposed to overcome confounding and immortal-time biases within the emulated trial framework. This tutorial provides a step-by-step description of the design and analysis of emulated trials, as well as R and Stata code, to facilitate its use in practice. The steps consist in: (i) specifying the target trial and inclusion criteria; (ii) cloning patients; (iii) defining censoring and survival times; (iv) estimating the weights to account for informative censoring introduced by design; and (v) analysing these data. These steps are illustrated with observational data to assess the benefit of surgery among 70\textendash 89-year-old patients diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer. Because of the severe unbalance of the patient characteristics between treatment arms (surgery yes/no), a na\textasciidieresis\i ve Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the initial cohort severely overestimated the benefit of surgery on 1-year survival (22\% difference), as did a survival analysis of the cloned dataset when informative censoring was ignored (17\% difference). By contrast, the estimated weights adequately removed the covariate imbalance. The weighted analysis still showed evidence of a benefit, though smaller (11\% difference), of surgery among older lung cancer patients on 1-year survival. Complementing the CERBOT tool, this tutorial explains how to proceed to conduct emulated trials using observational data in the presence of immortal-time bias. The strength of this approach is its transparency and its principles that are easily understandable by non-specialists.},

We analyzed the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) data to estimate the risk of AD death in (i) cancer patients relative to reference populations stratified on demographic and clinical variables, and (ii) female breast cancer (BC) patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, relative to those with no/unknown treatment status. Our results demonstrate the impact of race, cancer type, age and time since cancer diagnosis on the risk of AD death in cancer patients. While the risk of AD death was decreased in white patients diagnosed with various cancers at 45 or more years of age, it was increased in black patients diagnosed with cancers before 45 years of age (likely due to early onset AD). Chemotherapy decreased the risk of AD death in white women diagnosed with BC at the age of 65 or more, however radiotherapy displayed a more complex pattern with early decrease and late increase in the risk of AD death during a prolonged time interval after the treatment. Our data point to links between molecular mechanisms involved in cancer and AD, and to the potential applicability of some anti-cancer treatments against AD.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Pragmatic randomized trials are important tools for shared decision-making, but no guidance exists on patients' preferences for types of causal information. We aimed to assess preferences of patients and investigators toward causal effects in pragmatic randomized trials. Study Design and Setting: We (a) held three focus groups with patients (n 5 23) in Boston, MA; (b) surveyed (n 5 12) and interviewed (n 5 5) investigators with experience conducting pragmatic trials; and (c) conducted a systematic literature review of pragmatic trials (n 5 63). Results: Patients were distrustful of new-to-market medications unless substantially more effective than existing choices, preferred stratified absolute risks, and valued adherence-adjusted analyses when they expected to adhere. Investigators wanted both intention-totreat and per-protocol effects but felt methods for estimating per-protocol effects were lacking. When estimating per-protocol effects, many pragmatic trials used inappropriate methods to adjust for adherence and loss to follow-up. Conclusion: We made four recommendations for pragmatic trials to improve patient centeredness: (1) focus on superiority in effectiveness or safety, rather than noninferiority; (2) involve patients in specifying a priori subgroups; (3) report absolute measures of risk; and (4) complement intention-to-treat effect estimates with valid per-protocol effect estimates. \'O 2018 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the incidence of cancer in persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) and the incidence of AD dementia in persons with cancer. Methods: This was a cohort study in Northern Italy on more than 1 million residents. Cancer incidence was derived from the local health authority (ASL-Mi1) tumor registry and AD dementia incidence from registries of drug prescriptions, hospitalizations, and payment exemptions. Expected cases of AD dementia were calculated by applying the age-, sex-, and calendar year\textendash specific incidence rates observed in the whole population to the subgroup constituted of persons with newly diagnosed cancers during the observation period (2004\textendash 2009). The same calculations were carried out for cancers in patients with AD dementia. Separate analyses were carried out for the time period preceding or following the index diagnosis for survivors and nonsurvivors until the end of 2009 and for different types and sites of cancer. Results: The risk of cancer in patients with AD dementia was halved, and the risk of AD dementia in patients with cancer was 35\% reduced. This relationship was observed in almost all subgroup analyses, suggesting that some anticipated potential confounding factors did not significantly influence the results. Conclusions: The occurrence of both cancer and AD dementia increases exponentially with age, but with an inverse relationship; older persons with cancer have a reduced risk of AD dementia and vice versa. As AD dementia and cancer are negative hallmarks of aging and senescence, we suggest that AD dementia, cancer, and senescence could be manifestations of a unique phenomenon related to human aging.

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies show a reciprocal inverse association between cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The common mechanistic theory for this effect posits that cells have an innate tendency toward apoptotic or survival pathways, translating to increased risk for either neurodegeneration or cancer. However, it has been shown that cancer patients experience cognitive dysfunction pre- and post-treatment as well as alterations in cerebral gray matter density (GMD) on MRI. To further investigate these issues, we analyzed the association between cancer history (CA{$\pm$}) and age of AD onset, and the relationship between GMD and CA{$\pm$} status across diagnostic groups in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort study. Data was analyzed from 1609 participants with information on baseline cancer history and AD diagnosis, age of AD onset, and baseline MRI scans. Participants were CA+ (N = 503) and CA- (N = 1106) diagnosed with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), significant memory concerns (SMC), and cognitively normal older adults. As in previous studies, CA+ was inversely associated with AD at baseline (P = 0.025); interestingly, this effect appears to be driven by nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the largest cancer category in this study (P = 0.001). CA+ was also associated with later age of AD onset (P {$<$} 0.001), independent of apolipoprotein E (APOE) {$\epsilon$}4 allele status, and individuals with two prior cancers had later mean age of AD onset than those with one or no prior cancer (P {$<$} 0.001), suggesting an additive effect. Voxel-based morphometric analysis of GMD showed CA+ had lower GMD in the right superior frontal gyrus compared to CA- across diagnostic groups (Pcrit {$<$} 0.001, uncorrected); this cluster of lower GMD appeared to be driven by history of invasive cancer types, rather than skin cancer. Thus, while cancer history is associated with a measurable delay in AD onset independent of APOE {$\epsilon$}4, the underlying mechanism does not appear to be cancer-related preservation of GMD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare long-term memory trajectories before and after incident cancer with memory trajectories of similarly aged individuals not diagnosed with cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study included 14 583 US adults born before 1949 with no cancer history from the Health and Retirement Study. Biennial assessments were performed for up to 16 years from 1998 to 2014. Data analysis was performed from January 8 to October 5, 2018. EXPOSURES Self-reported physician diagnosis of any cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) during follow-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A composite memory score standardized to a mean (SD) of 0 (1) at baseline was based on immediate and delayed word-list recall and proxy assessments. The rate of memory change among people diagnosed with cancer during follow-up before and after diagnosis was compared with rate of memory change in individuals who remained cancer free during follow-up using linear mixed-effect models with random intercepts and slopes. RESULTS A total of 14 583 participants were included in the sample (mean [SD] age, 66.4 [10.4] years; 8453 [58.0\%] female). The mean (SD) follow-up was 11.5 (5.1) years; 2250 had a cancer diagnosis during follow-up, and 12 333 had no cancer diagnosis during follow-up. The rate of memory decline in the decade before a cancer diagnosis was 10.5\% (95\% CI, 6.2\%-14.9\%), which was slower than memory decline in similarly aged cancer-free individuals. For individuals diagnosed at 75 years of age, mean memory function immediately before diagnosis was 0.096 SD units (95\% CI, 0.0600.133 SD units) higher compared with that among similarly aged cancer-free individuals. A new cancer diagnosis was associated with a short-term decline in memory of -0.058 (95\% CI, -0.084 to -0.032) SD units compared with memory before diagnosis. After diagnosis, the rate of memory decline was 3.9\% (95\% CI, 0.9\%-6.9\%) slower in individuals with cancer than in those without a cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, older individuals who developed cancer had better memory and slower memory decline than did similarly aged individuals who remained cancer free. These findings support the possibility of a common pathologic process working in opposite directions in cancer and Alzheimer disease.},

  abstract = {Objective High blood pressure is one of the main modifiable risk factors for dementia. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the best antihypertensive class for optimizing cognition. Our objective was to determine whether any particular antihypertensive class was associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline or dementia using comprehensive meta-analysis including reanalysis of original participant data. Methods To identify suitable studies, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO and preexisting study consortia were searched from inception to December 2017. Authors of prospective longitudinal human studies or trials of antihypertensives were contacted for data sharing and collaboration. Outcome measures were incident dementia or incident cognitive decline (classified using the reliable change index method). Data were separated into mid and late-life ({$>$}65 years) and each antihypertensive class was compared to no treatment and to treatment with other antihypertensives. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data. Results Over 50,000 participants from 27 studies were included. Among those aged {$>$}65 years, with the exception of diuretics, we found no relationship by class with incident cognitive decline or dementia. Diuretic use was suggestive of benefit in some analyses but results were not consistent across follow-up time, comparator group, and outcome. Limited data precluded meaningful analyses in those {$\leq$}65 years of age. Conclusion Our findings, drawn from the current evidence base, support clinical freedom in the selection of antihypertensive regimens to achieve blood pressure goals.},

We nested 2 case-control studies in a subsample of a large cohort of 1,000,000 resident in Lombardy Region in Italy (n = 1515), followed-up for cancer and AD/PD occurrence since 1991 until 2012. Conditional logistic regression was performed to determine the odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of AD/PD in subjects with and without cancer and the risk of cancer in those with and without AD/PD. A total of 54 incident cases of AD/PD and 347 cancer cases were matched with 216 and 667 controls, respectively. After controlling for low education, obesity, history of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, physical activity, smoking habit, alcohol consumption, and dietary habit, cancer was found inversely associated with the risk of AD/PD (OR, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.32-1.38), and the risk of cancer in AD/PD was similarly reduced (OR, 0.42; 95\% CI, 0.20-0.91).

  abstract = {Studies reporting an inverse association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer are scant. Available data are mostly based on ancillary findings of mortality data or obtained from studies evaluating frequency of neoplasms in AD patients independently if they occurred before or after AD. Moreover, some studies estimated frequencies of neoplasms in demented individuals, who were not necessarily AD patients. We estimated frequency of tumors preceding the onset of AD in AD patients and compared it to that of age- and gender-matched AD-free individuals. Occurrence of tumors preceding AD onset was assessed through a semi-structured questionnaire. Tumors were categorized as benign, malignant, or of uncertain classification and as endocrine-related or not. Odds ratios (OR), used as measure of the association between the two diseases, were adjusted for tumor categories and known risk factors for AD and tumors. We included 126 AD patients and 252 matched controls. Tumor frequency before AD onset was 18.2\% among cases and 24.2\% among controls. There was a suggestive trend of an overall inverse association between the two diseases (adjusted OR 0.6; 95\% CI 0.4\textendash 1.1; p = 0.11). Risk for neoplasms was significantly reduced only for women (adjusted OR, 0.5; 95\% CI 0.3\textendash 0.9; p = 0.03) and for endocrine related tumors (adjusted OR, 0.5; 95\% CI 0.2\textendash 1; p = 0.04). Our study confirms the inverse association reported in previous epidemiological studies. Though our findings might be explained by processes playing an opposite role in tumors development and neurodegeneration, they are also suggestive for a possible role of estrogen.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous studies have demonstrated a strong inverse association between cancer and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to further investigate this association by examining measures of cognitive performance and neuroimaging. Methods: Neuropsychological (NP) test batteries consisting of quantitative measures of memory and executive function and volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans measuring brain and white-matter hyperintensity volumes were administered to 2,043 dementia-free participants (54\% women) in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort from 1999\textendash 2005. History of cancer was assessed at examination visits and through hospital records. Linear regression was used to examine the association between cancer history and NP/MRI variables. Results: There were 252 and 1,791 participants with and without a previous history of cancer, respectively. Cancer survivors had an average time between diagnosis and NP/MRI exam of 9.8 years. History of any invasive cancer was associated with better executive function (Beta=0.16, p=0.04) but not memory function. Non-invasive cancer was not associated with any change in cognitive performance. Patients with prostate cancer had larger frontal brain volumes (Beta=4.13, p=0.03). Cancer history was not associated with any other MRI measure. Conclusions: We did not find any strong evidence linking cancer to cognitive or neuroimaging biomarkers that would explain a lower risk of subsequent AD, although a previous FHS study demonstrated a strong inverse association between cancer and risk of AD. Future work should examine the association between cancer and other biomarkers of AD as well as more sensitive metrics of AD-related brain aging markers.},

In this paper, we present evidence that bactrim therapy improves survival but that the standard intent-to-treat comparison failed to detect this survival advantage because a large fraction of the subjects either crossed over to the other therapy or stopped therapy altogether. We obtain our evidence of a beneficial bactrim effect on survival by artificially regarding the subjects as dependently censored at the first time the subject either stops or switches therapy; we then analyze the data with the inverse probability of censoring weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox partial likelihood estimators of Robins (1993, Proceedings of the Biopharmaceutical Section, American Statistical Association, pp. 24-33) that adjust for dependent censoring by utilizing data collected on time-dependent prognostic factors.},

Participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study\textendash Cognition Substudy, a prospective cohort study, aged 65 years or older (n ϭ 3,020) were followed a mean of 5.4 years for dementia and 8.3 years for cancer. Results: The presence of any AD (pure AD ϩ mixed AD/VaD; hazard ratio [HR] ϭ 0.41, 95\% confidence interval [CI] ϭ 0.20 \textendash{} 0.84) and pure AD (HR ϭ 0.31, 95\% CI ϭ 0.12\textendash{} 0.86) was associated with a reduced risk of future cancer hospitalization, adjusted for demographic factors, smoking, obesity, and physical activity. No significant associations were found between dementia at baseline and rate of cancer hospitalizations for participants with diagnoses of VaD. Prevalent cancer was associated with reduced risk of any AD (HR ϭ 0.72; 95\% CI ϭ 0.52\textendash{} 0.997) and pure AD (HR ϭ 0.57; 95\% CI ϭ 0.36 \textendash{} 0.90) among white subjects after adjustment for demographics, number of APOE ⑀4 alleles, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease; the opposite association was found among minorities, but the sample size was too small to provide stable estimates. No significant association was found between cancer and subsequent development of VaD. Conclusions: In white older adults, prevalent Alzheimer disease (AD) was longitudinally associated with a reduced risk of cancer, and a history of cancer was associated with a reduced risk of AD. Together with other work showing associations between cancer and Parkinson disease, these findings suggest the possibility that cancer is linked to neurodegeneration.

  abstract = {Several of the hypothesized or studied exposures that may affect dementia risk are known to increase the risk of death. This may explain counterintuitive results, where exposures that are known to be harmful for mortality risk sometimes seem protective for the risk of dementia. Authors have attempted to explain these counterintuitive results as biased, but the bias associated with a particular analytic method cannot be defined or assessed if the causal question is not explicitly specified. Indeed, we can consider several causal questions when competing events like death, which cannot be prevented by design, are present. Current dementia research guidelines have not explicitly considered what constitutes a meaningful causal question in this setting or, more generally, how this choice justifies and should drive particular analytic decisions. To contextualize current practices, we first perform a systematic review of the conduct and interpretation of longitudinal studies focused on dementia outcomes where death is a competing event. We then describe and demonstrate how to address different causal questions (referred here as ``the total effect'' and ``the controlled direct effect'') with traditional analytic approaches under explicit assumptions. Our application focuses on smoking cessation in late-midlife. To illustrate core concepts, we discuss this example both in terms of a hypothetical randomized trial and with an emulation of such a trial using observational data from the Rotterdam Study.},

  abstract = {Background Global development goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress. To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous studies have found that the incidence of dementia is lower in patients with cancer. However, the impact of survival bias, as well as the confounding by medical treatment, have not been fully addressed. We aimed to explore the subsequent risk of dementia in different follow-up intervals among patients with cancer, as well as the risk before the diagnosis of cancer. Methods: By using the Swedish Cancer Register and the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, we systematically examined the risk of dementia among patients diagnosed with 35 different types of cancer. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to calculate the relative risk. Results: The subsequent risk of dementia in patients with cancer decreased by 21\% compared to matched cancer-free controls (SIR = 0.79, 95\% CI 0.78\textendash 0.80). For specific cancer sites, 21 of them had a significantly lower risk of subsequent dementia. The decreased risk of dementia was also significant before the diagnosis of cancer. However, the risk was higher among patients with cancer who survived for more than 10 years' post-diagnosis (SIR = 1.37, 95\% CI 1.32\textendash 1.41). Conclusions: In this population-based study, we found that the risk of dementia was lower among patients with cancer, and the risk was also lower before the diagnosis of cancer. This suggests that lower dementia risk is not simply due to bias. However, the underlying mechanisms need to be explored further.},

  abstract = {Purpose The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) in patients with cancer outside central nervous system (CNS), its incidence and prevalence, the cognitive pattern in neuropsychological studies, neuroimaging findings, and the relationship between chemobrain and aging. Methodological limitations of studies are also discussed. Methods This review was guided by the PRISMA statement. The MEDLINE and Scopus databases were employed to search articles about CRCI in non-CNS cancer patients published from January 2004 to September 2019. Two types of research were reviewed: prospective studies addressing the effects of chemotherapy on cognition and systematic reviews about factors related with CRCI, also as neuroimaging findings and current available treatments. Results Fifty-nine studies meeting the criteria were analyzed: 47 were longitudinal studies on cancer and cognition and 12 were reviews on risk factors, neuroimaging, and treatment. The majority of studies find cognitive impairment in patients with cancer treated with chemotherapy. The body of the literature on breast cancer is the most abundant, but there are also studies on colorectal, testicular, and lung cancer. Neuroimaging studies show changes in structure and activation in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Non-pharmacological treatment is effective for improving cognition and quality of life. Conclusions The occurrence of CRCI during the course of treatment in people with different types of cancer is frequent. Some risk factors have been identified, but CRCI is a complex phenomenon, with mediating factors related to cancer and treatment and moderating factors related with lifestyle and health.},

The probability that Yi will exceed a preassigned t is called the i-th net survival probability. The results of a survival experiment are represented by kI "crude" survival functions, empirical counterparts of the probabilities Qi(t) that an animal will survive at least up to the age t and eventually die from Ri. The analysis of a survival experiment aims at estimating the k net survival probabilities using the empirical data on those termed crude. Theorems 1 and 2 establish the relationship between the net and the crude probabilities of survival. In particular, Theorem 2 shows that, without the not directly verifiable assumption that in their joint distribution the variables Y1, Y2, **, kare mutually independent, a given set of crude survival probabilities Qi(t) does not identify the corresponding net probabilities. An example shows that the results of a customary method of analysis, based on the assumption that Yi, Y2, ., Ykare independent, may have no resemblance to reality.},

  abstract = {Noncentral nervous system cancer and the brain share an interesting and complex relation, with an emerging body of evidence showing that cancer patients are at an increased risk of developing cognitive problems. In contrast, population-based studies consistently find an inverse link between cancer and dementia, that is patients with dementia having a lower risk of subsequently developing cancer, and cancer patients being less often diagnosed with dementia. Different biological processes such as inversely activated cell proliferation and survival pathways have been suggested to have an important role underlying this inverse association. However, the effect of methodological biases including surveillance or survival bias has not been completely ruled out, calling into question the inverse direction of the association between cancer and dementia. In fact, emerging evidence now suggests that cancer and dementia might share a positive association. This narrative review summarises the current literature on cancer, cognitive problems and dementia. Moreover, different strategies will be discussed to reduce the impact of potential methodological biases on the association between cancer and dementia, trying to reveal the true direction of this link.},

  abstract = {Time-to-event analyses are frequently used in nephrology research, for instance, when recording time to death or time to peritonitis in dialysis patients. Many papers have pointed out the important issue of competing events (or competing risks) in such analyses. For example, when studying one particular cause of death it can be noted that patients also die from other causes. Such competing events preclude the event of interest from occurring and thereby complicate the statistical analysis. The Kaplan\textendash Meier approach to calculating the cumulative probability of the event of interest yields invalid results in the presence of competing risks, thus the alternative cumulative incidence competing risk (CICR) approach has become the standard. However, when kidney transplant is the competing event that prevents observing the outcome of interest, CICR may not always be the matter of interest. We discuss situations where both the Kaplan\textendash Meier and the CICR approach are not suitable for the purpose and point out alternative analysis methods for such situations. We also look at the suitability and interpretation of different estimators for relative risks. In the presence of transplant as a competing risk, one should very clearly state the research question and use an analysis method that targets this question.},

Both calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are suggested to have a more pronounced protective effect. We aimed to study the association between different classes of AHM and dementia in older people. Methods: A subgroup of community-dwelling older people using AHM included in the `Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care' randomized controlled trial was studied. Incident dementia rates in participants with different AHM classes (mono and combination therapy) were compared with dementia rates in participants with any other AHM. Results: At baseline, 1951 participants (55.3\%) used AHM [mean age, 74.4 year (SD 2.5); mean SBP, 156.4 mmHg (SD 21.5)]. In total, 986 participants (50.5\%) used bblockers, 798 diuretics (40.9\%), 623 angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (31.9\%), 522 CCBs (26.8\%), and 402 ARBs (20.6\%). After 6.7 years (interquartile range 6.0\textendash 7.3) of follow-up, 136 participants (7.0\%) developed dementia. Both use of CCBs [hazard ratio 0.56, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 0.36\textendash 0.87] and ARBs (hazard ratio 0.60, 95\% CI 0.37\textendash 0.98) were independently associated with a decreased risk of dementia. The association of CCBs with dementia was most apparent in participants without a history of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio 0.38, 95\% CI 0.18\textendash 0.81) and with uncontrolled hypertension (hazard ratio 0.26, 95\% CI 0.11\textendash 0.61). SBP was not significantly lower in participants using CCBs or ARBs. Conclusion: Both use of CCBs and ARBs are independently associated with a decreased risk of dementia in older people.},

Study Design and Setting: The Neurological Disorders in Central Spain study is a longitudinal, population-based survey of chronic neurologic conditions in persons aged {$>$}65 years. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine baseline differences between participants who took part in the 3-year follow-up evaluation vs. those who did not. Results: Of the 5,278 participants evaluated at baseline (1994e1995), 1,482 (28.1\%) were lost to the follow-up (1997e1998). Factors that were associated with dropout due to refusal were as follows: living in a rural area and being single. Contact failure was associated with older age and being unmarried and widowed. Unreachable participants were less likely to take three or more medications or live in a professional neighborhood. Predictors of dropout due to death were male gender, older age, having impaired activities of daily living, taking more medications, poor self-perceived health, dementia, and smoking. Conclusions: These findings on participants who are at high risk of dropout may be useful in the planning phase of future prospective studies. Of the possible reasons for attrition, refusal is the most important because it is amenable to change. \'O 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the association of midlife to late-life BP patterns with subsequent dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitive decline. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities prospective population-based cohort study enrolled 4761 participants during midlife (visit 1, 1987-1989) and followed-up over 6 visits through 2016-2017 (visit 6). BP was examined over 24 years at 5 in-person visits between visits 1 and 5 (2011-2013). During visits 5 and 6, participants underwent detailed neurocognitive evaluation. The setting was 4 US communities: Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Follow-up ended on December 31, 2017. EXPOSURES Five groups based on longitudinal patterns of normotension, hypertension ({$>$}140/90 mm Hg), and hypotension ({$<$}90/60 mm Hg) at visits 1 to 5. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was dementia onset after visit 5, based on Ascertain Dementia-8 informant questionnaires, Six-Item Screener telephone assessments, hospital discharge and death certificate codes, and the visit 6 neurocognitive evaluation. Secondary outcome was mild cognitive impairment at visit 6, based on the neurocognitive evaluation. RESULTS Among 4761 participants (2821 [59\%] women; 979 [21\%] black race; visit 5 mean [SD] age, 75 [5] years; visit 1 mean age range, 44-66 years; visit 5 mean age range, 66-90 years), there were 516 (11\%) incident dementia cases between visits 5 and 6. The dementia incidence rate for participants with normotension in midlife (n = 833) and late life was 1.31 (95\% CI, 1.00-1.72 per 100 person-years); for midlife normotension and late-life hypertension (n = 1559), 1.99 (95\% CI, 1.69-2.32 per 100 person-years); for midlife and late-life hypertension (n = 1030), 2.83 (95\% CI, 2.40-3.35 per 100 person-years); for midlife normotension and late-life hypotension (n = 927), 2.07 (95\% CI, 1.68-2.54 per 100 person-years); and for midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension (n = 389), 4.26 (95\% CI, 3.40-5.32 per 100 person-years). Participants in the midlife and late-life hypertension group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95\% CI, 1.06-2.08]) and in the midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension group (HR, 1.62 [95\% CI, 1.11-2.37]) had significantly increased risk of subsequent dementia compared with those who remained normotensive. Irrespective of late-life BP, sustained hypertension in midlife was associated with dementia risk (HR, 1.41 [95\% CI, 1.17-1.71]). Compared with those who were normotensive in midlife and late life, only participants with midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension had higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (37 affected individuals (odds ratio, 1.65 [95\% CI, 1.01-2.69]). There was no significant association of BP patterns with late-life cognitive change. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this community-based cohort with long-term follow-up, sustained hypertension in midlife to late life and a pattern of midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension, compared with midlife and late-life normal BP, were associated with increased risk for subsequent dementia.},

Cox proportional hazards models were used to test associations between NMSC and subsequent risk of developing a neurocognitive disorder. To deduce a biologically specific association between AD and NMSC, we considered 3 nested outcomes groups: only AD (probable or possible AD as the sole diagnosis), any AD (probable AD or possible AD, as well as mixed AD/ vascular dementia), and all-cause dementia. Results: We followed 1,102 adults with a mean age of 79 years at enrollment.

  abstract = {Objectives: Inverse probability of treatment weighted Kaplan-Meier estimates have been developed to compare two treatments in the presence of confounders in observational studies. Recently, stabilized weights were developed to reduce the influence of extreme inverse probability of treatment-weighted weights in estimating treatment effects. The objective of this research was to use adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests to examine the effect of a treatment that varies over time in an observational study. Methods: We proposed stabilized weight adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests when the treatment was time-varying over the follow-up period. We applied these new methods in examining the effect of an anti-platelet agent, clopidogrel, on subsequent events, including bleeding, myocardial infarction, and death after a drug-eluting stent was implanted into a coronary artery. In this population, clopidogrel use may change over time based on a patient's behavior (e.g., nonadherence) and physicians' recommendations (e.g., end of duration of therapy). Consequently, clopidogrel use was treated as a time-varying variable. Results: We demonstrate that 1) the sample sizes at three chosen time points are almost identical in the original and weighted datasets; and 2) the covariates between patients on and off clopidogrel were well balanced after stabilized weights were applied to the original samples. Conclusions: The stabilized weight-adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates and modified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests are useful in presenting and comparing survival functions for time-varying treatments in observational studies while adjusting for known confounders.},

  abstract = {Background: Cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common diseases of aging and share many risk factors. Surprisingly, however, epidemiologic data from several recent independent cohort studies suggest that there may be an inverse association between these diseases. Objective: To determine the relationship between history of cancer and odds of dementia proximate to death and neuropathological indices of AD. Methods: Using data from two separate clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging and AD, the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), we compared odds of AD dementia proximate to death among participants with and without a history of cancer. We then examined the relation of history of cancer with measures of AD pathology at autopsy, i.e., paired helical filament tau (PHFtau) neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-NL load. Results: Participants reporting a history of cancer had significantly lower odds of AD (OR 0.70 [0.55\textendash 0.89], p = 0.0040) proximate to death as compared to participants reporting no prior history of cancer. The results remained significant after adjusting for multiple risk factors including age, sex, race, education, and presence of an APOE ␧4 allele. At autopsy, participants with a history of cancer had significantly fewer PHFtau tangles (p {$<$} 0.001) than participants without a history of cancer, but similar levels of amyloid-NL. Conclusions: Cancer survivors have reduced odds of developing AD and a lower burden of neurofibrillary tangle deposition.},
