### 4.2. Results


Participants had a mean age of `r mean_age`, and `r women_prop` were women. Further details on participants are presented in Table 1. Over follow-up, `r yes_cancer` developed cancer and `r no_cancer` remain free of cancer diagnosis, the median age of cancer diagnosis was `r cancer_time`. From the total sample, `r dem_total` had dementia over follow-up and median time to dementia was `r dem_time`. Among participants with incident cancer, `r cancer_dem` had dementia diagnosis and `r cancer_death` died over follow-up, `r cancer_alive` remain alive at 20 years since study entry. In contrast, among participants free of cancer diagnosis over follow-up, `r no_cancer_dem` were diagnosed with dementia and `r no_cancer_death` died over follow-up, `r no_cancer_alive` were alive at the end of follow-up. Figure x. shows the magnitude of the proportion of people who died over time.

Results for all scenarios are present in Table 2. Had we defined cancer diagnosis as _ever vs. never_, and relying on death as independent censoring event (unconditional), we observe a significant protective effect of ever having cancer in the risk of dementia [RR: `r table_results[2,6]` (95%CI), HR:  `r table_results[2,7]`]. However this effect is diminished [RR: `r table_results[3,6]` (95%CI),
HR: `r table_results[3,7]`)] if we relax the assumption of independent censoring conditional on baseline covariates related to death.

Had we defined cancer diagnosis as a _time-varying_ exposure we observe higher risk of dementia had participants had a cancer diagnosis over time, had we prevented death conditional on covariates [RR: `r table_results[6,6]` (95%CI), HR: `r table_results[6,7]`)].

[should include some final comments on this being interpreted as back to the original question about Pin1, rather than being results about the particular estimates from the models too, but I think we need to discuss the analyses first.]



## 5. Discussion (brainstorming points)

- We observed how definition of cancer diagnosis as the proxy of Pin1 over-expression changes results. Most papers focus on a methodology but not on the question behind. Only with this in mind we can consider the confounders of the association. If the question was instead related to different cancer treatments it would require a different design and definition of confounders. And if we consider treatments given at a different time in life too. And how we want to think about which effect is of interest given competing events. As opposed to Ospina's paper that says this:

_"Confounders that would explain the observed inverse cancer-AD association would be those that raise risk of cancer but reduce risk of AD, ruling out many common lifestyle and social factors associated with increased risk of both conditions, such as smoking or alcohol consumption. We considered age, sex, and educational level as sociodemographic factors that should be included in a minimal adjustment set in all studies on this association."_

- Previous studies classified "competing risk bias" vs. "survival bias" which is unclear. We first need to pick an estimand. If we are interested in the CDE or any closely-related direct effect kind of question? we rely a strong assumptions. But to consider that unconditional independecy makes no sense. Results change substantially if we relax this assumption with covariates. Also bounds show us the extent of extreme scenarios. Also a large proportion of cancer patients died prior to dementia diagnosis (`r cancer_death`), the leading cause of death was cancer in this group.

- Besides, all estimands can be presented as risks, but depending on the estimand it treats death differently, and under different assumptions, and time-varying hazards (period specific hazards) are not useful.


Efforts to prevent and treat cancer should converge with similar efforts to prevent other aging- associated diseases. We need to figure out what the key aging-dependent changes are and how to modulate these factors safely.

<!-- Causes such as aging, smoking, irradiation etc are causing micro environmental changes, like inflamation and changes in tissue remodelling. This promotes selection for adaptive mutations.Youthful tissues -->

- Knowing the cause of death provides information about the direction of missclassification. Among individuals free of cancer, we observed % of individuals who died with cancer as a primary cause.

- Explicitly outlining the estimands and the assumptions that connect the causal question to the observed data provide an opportunity to improve the design of observational studies and the interpretation of their findings, plus better insight of potential sources of bias.

- This is a crucial since these studies are providing insights that are guiding other fields of research in the area, from bench science to biostatistics and epidemiological methods.

- The CDE has an interpretation that relates to an scenario where death was eliminated. Future work on separable effects may help disentangle the different mechanisms that affect dementia and death.

- In the future, we may be able to measure this biomarker and collect data retrospectively from stored blood samples, but we need to design the study very carefuly.

- We could have change Pin1 to other molecular mechanism (MAYBE). This also extends to other questions that study the effect of one disease in the risk of another disease to understand the biological mechanisms behind the.

Some of the covariates that are represented by $L$ could include: screening guidelines, type of health care coverage, health-seeking behaviors, and health care availability. These covariates would also explain the potential unmeasured and differential measurement error that affect cancer, death and also ADRD over follow-up. 

Although this means we could measure the biomarker at a particular time in everyone, defined by the cohort study design, an unanswered question that would remain is related to the best time to measure the biomarker in an applied setting. This question is beyond the scope of this exercise and for didactic purpose we may consider that the study entrance (and subsequent data collection) date was part of a screening process.
